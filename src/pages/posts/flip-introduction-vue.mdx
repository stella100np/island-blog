## TL;DR

After changing the data, use [nextTick](https://vuejs.org/api/general.html#nexttick) to get the new dom value.

## A FLIP demo of vue3

When we change some reactive variables, `Vue.js` automatically updates the dom, but this update is not instantaneous. For example, when we set `current.value = v`, it triggers re-render, the `div` inside the `ol` will be changed.

How do we know this rendering is over and the [Paint](./flip-introduction-prologue) has not yet begun? `Vue.js` provides a function to solve this problem: [nextTick](https://vuejs.org/api/general.html#nexttick).
After it ,we get a new dom, then we can gets some properties such as position and transparency.
Further, we can continue the flip steps(invert and play) like [those](./what-is-FLIP) before.

<Sandpack

    showNavigator: true,
    editorHeight: 350,
    editorWidthPercentage: 70,
  }}
  files={{ "/src/App.vue": vuecode }}

  class="no-prose"
